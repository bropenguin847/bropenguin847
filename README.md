I'm an Electronics Enthusiast and I love all things Electronics.⭐️⚡️💥🛠️


My repo consists of the projects I've built from the past. Such as C++ calculator and an ESP32 controller bluetooth car.
Currently, I'm working on building what I learned from my scientific programming course. I want the repo to consists of Notes, Exercises, Scripts to try on and others.
These are for my own personal reference, and maybe for my friends to check out on.

In the future,  I would like to decorate my profile with my own personal website.
Future projects:
- Real Time Vibration Analysis
- Python chat bot
- Hacking hardware
- Making a game with python
- Automating with Python
- Personal Website / Web Resume with Python
- (Need to learn about HTTP methods and APIs, Request module, build simple website with Flask, django & fastAPI)
