I am an Electronics Enthusiast and Hobbyist and I love all things electronics. ⭐️⚡️💥🛠️

I started my Electronics journey when I was in my Diploma days. From dismantling electic steamer
to custom designing my own PCB. I like to do projects that resonate with my interest and or it is just plain cool!

My repo consists of the projects I've built from the past. Such as C++ calculator and an ESP32 controller bluetooth car.
The project that I am most proud of is my Notes Collection from my Scientific Programming course. The repo consists of Notes, Exercises, Scripts to try on and many more.
Initially, these are for my own personal reference. Now, I maintain it for my friends to check out on.

In the future,  I would like to decorate my profile with my own personal website. Built from the ground up.

Here are a few of my upcoming projects:
- PCB name card
- Hexapod
- Hacking hardware
- Making a game with Python
- Python chat bot
- Automating with Python
- Personal Website / Web Resume with Python (Self Host)
  (HTTP methods and APIs, Request module, build simple website with Flask, django & fastAPI)
