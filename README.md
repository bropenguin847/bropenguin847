## ðŸ’€Hello there!!
**Call me Penguin**
or *Keith* is fine too
I'm an Electronics Enthusiast and I love all things Electronics. <br>
My main programming language is Python and a little bit of C++. 


My repo consists of the projects I've built from the past. Such as C++ calculator and an ESP32 controller bluetooth car.

In the future,  I would like to decorate my profile with my own personal website.
Future projects:
- personal website
- Real Time Vibration Analysis
